INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>\n        <p>\n          It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections\n          without some information about you. We also collect information generated as\n          you use our services, for example access logs, as well as information from\n          third parties, like when you access our services through a social media\n          account. If you want additional info, we go into more details below.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Information you give us </h4>\n        <p>\n          You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This\n          includes:\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          • When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login\n          credentials (email), as well as some basic details necessary for the service to\n          work, such as your gender and year of birth. • When you complete your profile,\n          you can also upload a profile picture. To add a profile picture, you may allow\n          us to access your camera or photo album.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          • When you subscribe to interests, we require access to this information to be\n          able to match you with other users. We also require this information for other\n          features like Eavesdropping.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          • When you choose to match with other users by distance, you allow us to\n          collect location data that will be provided by your device's GPS services.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          • When you participate in surveys or focus groups, you give us your insights\n          into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          • When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we\n          collect the information that you use to register or enter.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          • If you contact our customer support team, we collect the information you give\n          us during the interaction. Sometimes, we monitor or record these interactions\n          for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          • If you ask us to communicate with or otherwise process information of other\n          people (for example, if you ask us to send an email on your behalf to one of\n          your friends), we collect the information about others that you give us in\n          order to complete your request.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          • Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well, as part of\n          the operation of the services. However, we do not store any chats on our\n          servers (only temporarily until it is sent, and then it will be deleted).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          • Chat messages in Match Chats (chats when we match you with other users by\n          interests) are free to be read by other users through the Eavesdropping\n          feature. If you need to have a private conversation with a user, you will need\n          to add that user as a friend.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          • Chat messages in Friend Chats (chats between your friends) are strictly\n          private between the two of you and no users outside of the two of you or third\n          party will have access to those chats.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Information we receive from others</h4>\n        <p>\n          In addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information\n          about you from others, including:\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"inline\">\n          <b>• Other Users</b>\n          <p>\n            Other users may provide information about you as they use our services.

The collection\n            of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren’t using\n            the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection.\n            If you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not\n            collect it.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <h3 id=\"3\">3.

Please be careful with your\n            information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you’re\n            comfortable being publicly viewable since neither you nor we can control what\n            others do with your information once you share it. If you choose to limit the\n            audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or\n            information about you, then it will be visible according to your settings.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"inline\">\n          <b>• With our service providers and partners</b>\n          <p>\n            We use third parties to help us operate and improve our services.

We may also share information with partners who\n            distribute and assist us in advertising our services.

YOUR RIGHTS</h3>\n        <p>\n          We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with\n          the following tools:\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          • <b>Device permissions.</b> Mobile platforms have permission systems for\n          specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone book and\n          location services as well as push notifications. You can change your settings\n          on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding\n          information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if\n          you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          • <b>Deletion.</b> You can delete your account by using the corresponding\n          functionality directly on the service.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a few key points to\n          remember:\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          • <b>Reviewing your information.</b>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Applicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal\n          information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be\n          called right of access, right of portability or variations of those terms). You\n          can request a copy of your personal information by contacting us at\n          support@smolltalk.com.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          • <b>Updating your information.</b>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we\n          are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification,\n          deletion or object to its processing, please contact us at\n          support@smolltalk.com.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to\n          provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the\n          request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual\n          property or the privacy of another user.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the\n          processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow\n          us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our\n          service if we do not have your year of birth and gender.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          • <b>Uninstall.</b> You can stop all information collection by an app by\n          uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device.\n        </p>\n        <h3 id=\"6\">6. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h3>\n        <p>\n          We work hard to protect you from unauthorised access to or alteration,\n          disclosure or destruction of your personal information. As with all technology\n          companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not\n          promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always\n          remain secure.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and\n          regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices\n          to update our physical, technical and organisational security measures.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we\n          suspect or detect any breach of security.

HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION</h3>\n        <p>\n          When you choose to delete your account, we immediately delete your information\n          from our systems (profile, friends, interests, etc), unless:\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          1. we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, some “traffic\n          data” is kept for one year to comply with statutory data retention\n          obligations);\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          2. we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for\n          instance, records of consents to our Terms, Privacy Policy and other similar\n          consents are kept for five years);\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          3. there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the\n          relevant information until it is resolved; or\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          4. the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as\n          fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security. For example,\n          information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe\n          behaviour or security incidents from opening a new account.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data\n          deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that\n          all data will be deleted within a specific timeframe due to technical\n          constraints.\n        </p>\n        <h3 id=\"8\">8.

We realized asking you \"What's your interests?\" is a\n      little bit tricky to answer, so intead we provide a platform that aggregates the\n      worlds interests, at your fingertips. Easily add interests and start matching with\n      others that share the same interests. Connecting and making friends with people\n      could never be simpler.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      With that done, we believed the next element is also essential in building\n      meaningful relationships.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Conversations</h2>\n    <p>\n      Conversations, dialog, idea exchanges, whatever you call it, it energizes us. For\n      users who are connecting with each other, we believe exclusivity is important.\n      Matching with someone should feel like both of you are engaged in real life small\n      talk. It can be a quick 5 minute conversation about each other's day, or a day long\n      conversation about the universe. Whatever the scenario, you should feel like\n      whoever you are talking to is present with you.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      With 7 billion of us on this beautiful planet, there is just so much to learn from\n      each other. So we introduced a rather interesting feature.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Eavesdropping</h2>\n    <p>\n      Eavesdropping is a way to watch conversations that are happening all around the\n      world! Whether you're having an interesting conversation or eavesdropping on one,\n      you can easily share that conversation with friends and let them see what you are\n      seeing.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Finally</h2>\n    <p>\n      We still have a lot of work to do for SmollTalk.
