        <h2>Online Behavior</h2>
        <h3>Protect Your Finances & Never Send Money or Financial Information</h3>
        <p>
          Never respond to any request to send money, especially overseas or via wire
          transfer, and report it to us immediately – even if the person claims to be in
          an emergency. Wiring money is like sending cash: the sender has no protections
          against loss and it’s nearly impossible to reverse the transaction or trace the
          money. For more information, click on the video below to the U.S. Federal Trade
          Commission's advice to avoid online dating scams, also available{' '}

          </a>
        </p>
        <h3>Protect Your Personal Information</h3>
        <p>
          Never give personal information, such as: your social security number, credit
          card number or bank information, or your work or home address to people you
          don’t know or haven’t met in person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: SmollTalk will never send you an email asking for your username and
          password information. Any such communication should be reported immediately.
        </p>
        <h3>Be Web Wise</h3>
        <p>
          Block and report suspicious users. You can block and report concerns about any
          suspicious user anonymously at any time on SmollTalk – while chatting after you
          are matched or after you are friends. Keep conversations on the platform. Bad
          actors will try to move the conversation to text, personal email or phone
          conversations.
        </p>
        <h3>Report All Suspicious Behavior</h3>
        <p>
          Additionally, please report anyone who violates our{' '}
          <a href="/terms">terms of use.</a>
        </p>
        <p>Examples of terms of use violations include:</p>
        <p />
        <section>
          <p>• Asks you for money or donations</p>
          <p>• Requesting photographs.</p>
          <p>• Minors using the platform</p>
          <p>• Users sending harassing or offensive messages</p>
          <p>• Users behaving inappropriately after meeting in person</p>
          <p>• Fraudulent registration or profiles.</p>
          <p>
            • Spam or solicitation, such as invitations to call 1-900 numbers or attempts
            to sell products or services.
          </p>
        </section>
        <h2>Offline Behavior</h2>
        <p>
          Connecting with someone new is exciting, but if you choose to meet a person
          that you have met on SmollTalk in real life (offline), please be aware of some
          safety guidelines:
        </p>
        <h3>Get to Know the Other Person</h3>
        <p>
          Keep your communications limited to the platform and really get to know users
          online/using the app before meeting them in person. Bad actors often push
          people to communicate off the platform immediately. It’s up to you to research
          and do your due diligence.
        </p>
        <h3>Always Meet and Stay in Public</h3>
        <p>
          Meet for the first time in a populated, public place – never in a private or
          remote location, and never at your home or apartment. If your date pressures
          you, end the date and leave at once.
        </p>
        <h3>Tell Your Friends and Family Members of Your Plans</h3>
        <p>
          Inform a friend or family member of your plans and when and where you’re going.
          Make sure you have your cell phone charged and with you at all times.
        </p>
        <h3>Transport Yourself to and from the Meeting</h3>
        <p>
          You need to be independent and in control of your own transportation,
          especially in case things don’t work out.
        </p>
        <h3>Stay Sober</h3>
        <p>
          Consumption of alcohol and/or other drugs can impair your judgment and
          potentially put you in danger. It’s important to keep a clear mind and avoid
          anything that might place you at risk. Be aware that bad actors might try to
          take advantage of you by altering your beverage(s) with synthetic substances.
