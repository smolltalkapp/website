          We appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend to always

          keeping legal and technical jargon to a minimum.

        <h3 id="1">1. WHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES</h3>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the SmollTalk App for both IOS and Android.</p>
        <h3 id="2">2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
        <p>
          It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections
          without some information about you. We also collect information generated as
          you use our services, for example access logs, as well as information from
          third parties, like when you access our services through a social media
          account. If you want additional info, we go into more details below.
        </p>
        <h4>Information you give us </h4>
        <p>
          You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This
          includes:
        </p>
        <p>
          • When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login
          credentials (email), as well as some basic details necessary for the service to
          work, such as your gender and year of birth. • When you complete your profile,
          you can also upload a profile picture. To add a profile picture, you may allow
          us to access your camera or photo album.
        </p>
        <p>
          • When you subscribe to interests, we require access to this information to be
          able to match you with other users. We also require this information for other
          features like Eavesdropping.
        </p>
        <p>
          • When you choose to match with other users by distance, you allow us to
          collect location data that will be provided by your device's GPS services.
        </p>
        <p>
          • When you participate in surveys or focus groups, you give us your insights
          into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials.
        </p>
        <p>
          • When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we
          collect the information that you use to register or enter.
        </p>
        <p>
          • If you contact our customer support team, we collect the information you give
          us during the interaction. Sometimes, we monitor or record these interactions
          for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service.
        </p>
        <p>
          • If you ask us to communicate with or otherwise process information of other
          people (for example, if you ask us to send an email on your behalf to one of
          your friends), we collect the information about others that you give us in
          order to complete your request.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well, as part of
          the operation of the services. However, we do not store any chats on our
          servers (only temporarily until it is sent, and then it will be deleted).
        </p>
        <p>
          • Chat messages in Match Chats (chats when we match you with other users by
          interests) are free to be read by other users through the Eavesdropping
          feature. If you need to have a private conversation with a user, you will need
          to add that user as a friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Chat messages in Friend Chats (chats between your friends) are strictly
          private between the two of you and no users outside of the two of you or third
          party will have access to those chats.
        </p>
        <h4>Information we receive from others</h4>
        <p>
          In addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information
          about you from others, including:
        </p>
        <div className="inline">
          <b>• Other Users</b>
          <p>
            Other users may provide information about you as they use our services. For
            instance, we may collect information about you from other users if they
            contact us about you.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="inline">
          <b>• Social Media</b>
          <p>
            You may be able to use your third party logins (such as Facebook or Google
            Login) to create and log into your SmollTalk account. This saves you from
            having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you to share
            some information from your social media account with us.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Information collected when you use our services</h4>
        <p>
          When you use our services, we collect information about which features you’ve
          used, how you’ve used them and the devices you use to access our services. See
          below for more details:
        </p>
        <div className="inline">
          <b>• Usage Information</b>
          <p>
            We collect information about your activity on our services, for instance how
            you use them (e.g., date and time you logged in, features you’ve been using,
            searches, clicks and pages which have been shown to you, referring webpage
            address, advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other users
            (e.g., users you connect and interact with, time and date of your exchanges,
            number of messages you send and receive).
          </p>
          <b>• Other information with your consent</b>
          <p>
            If you give us permission, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude
            and longitude) through various means, depending on the service and device
            you’re using, including GPS, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections. The collection
            of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren’t using
            the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection.
            If you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not
            collect it.
          </p>
        </div>

          To process your information as described above, we rely on the following legal
          bases:
        </p>
        <p>
          • Provide our service to you: Most of the time, the reason we process your
          information is to perform the contract that you have with us. For instance, as
          you go about using our service to build meaningful connections, we use the
          interests and other profile information such as age, gender and/or location to
          better match you with other users.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Legitimate interests: We may use your information where we have legitimate
          interests to do so. For instance, we analyse users’ behaviour on our services
          to continuously improve our offerings, we suggest offers we think might
          interest you, and we process information for administrative, fraud detection
          and other legal purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Consent: From time to time, we may ask for your consent to use your
          information for certain specific reasons. You may withdraw your consent at any
          time by contacting us at the address provided at the end of this Privacy
          Policy.
        </p>
        <h3 id="4">4. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>
          Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, the main sharing of
          users’ information is, of course, with other users.
        </p>
        <div className="inline">
          <b>• With other users</b>
          <p>
            When you become friends with other users on SmollTalk, you share profile
            information with other users and/or the interests that you are subscribed to
            (you can opt to not show this information). Please be careful with your
            information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you’re
            comfortable being publicly viewable since neither you nor we can control what
            others do with your information once you share it. If you choose to limit the
            audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or
            information about you, then it will be visible according to your settings.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="inline">
          <b>• With our service providers and partners</b>
          <p>
            We use third parties to help us operate and improve our services. These third
            parties assist us with various tasks, including data hosting and maintenance,
            analytics, customer care, marketing, advertising, payment processing and
            security operations. We may also share information with partners who
            distribute and assist us in advertising our services. For instance, we may
            share limited information on you in hashed, non-human readable form to
            advertising partners.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="inline">
          <b>• For corporate transactions</b>
          <p>
            We may transfer your information if we are involved, whether in whole or in
            part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring,
            reorganisation, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or
            control.

        </div>
        <div className="inline">
          <b>• When required by law</b>
          <p>
            We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with
            a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant,
            government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements; (ii)
            to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to
            applicable law); or (iii) to protect the safety of any person.

        </div>
        <div className="inline">
          <b>• To enforce legal rights</b>
          <p>
            We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability
            in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to protect our legal
            rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested
            parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate,
            prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or
            other wrongdoing.

        </div>
        <div className="inline">
          <b>• With your consent or at your request</b>
          <p>
            We may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties. In
            any such case, we will make it clear why we want to share the information. We
            may use and share non-personal information (meaning information that, by
            itself, does not identify who you are such as device information, general
            demographics, general behavioural data, geolocation in de-identified form),
            as well as personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, under any
            of the above circumstances. We may share your information to third parties
            (notably advertisers) to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our
            services and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyse and
            report on advertising you see. We may combine this information with
            additional non-personal information or personal information in hashed,
            non-human readable form collected from other sources.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="5">5. YOUR RIGHTS</h3>
        <p>
          We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with
          the following tools:
        </p>
        <p>
          • <b>Device permissions.</b> Mobile platforms have permission systems for
          specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone book and
          location services as well as push notifications. You can change your settings
          on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding
          information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if
          you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          • <b>Deletion.</b> You can delete your account by using the corresponding
          functionality directly on the service.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a few key points to
          remember:
        </p>
        <p>
          • <b>Reviewing your information.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Applicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal
          information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be
          called right of access, right of portability or variations of those terms). You
          can request a copy of your personal information by contacting us at
          support@smolltalk.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          • <b>Updating your information.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we
          are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification,
          deletion or object to its processing, please contact us at
          support@smolltalk.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to
          provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the
          request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual
          property or the privacy of another user.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the
          processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow
          us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our
          service if we do not have your year of birth and gender.
        </p>
        <p>
          • <b>Uninstall.</b> You can stop all information collection by an app by
          uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device.
        </p>
        <h3 id="6">6. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>
          We work hard to protect you from unauthorised access to or alteration,
          disclosure or destruction of your personal information. As with all technology
          companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not
          promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always
          remain secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and
          regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices
          to update our physical, technical and organisational security measures.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we
          suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that your account or
          information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately by emailing us at
          support@smolltalk.com.
        </p>
        <h3 id="7">7. HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>
          When you choose to delete your account, we immediately delete your information
          from our systems (profile, friends, interests, etc), unless:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, some “traffic
          data” is kept for one year to comply with statutory data retention
          obligations);
        </p>
        <p>
          2. we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for
          instance, records of consents to our Terms, Privacy Policy and other similar
          consents are kept for five years);
        </p>
        <p>
          3. there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the
          relevant information until it is resolved; or
        </p>
        <p>
          4. the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as
          fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security. For example,
          information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe
          behaviour or security incidents from opening a new account.

          Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data
          deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that
          all data will be deleted within a specific timeframe due to technical
          constraints.
