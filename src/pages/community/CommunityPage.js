        <h2>Community Guidelines</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to the SmollTalk community. If you’re honest, kind and respectful to
          others, you’ll always be welcome here. If you choose not to be, you may not
          last. Our goal is to allow users to express themselves freely as long as it
          doesn’t offend others. Everyone is held to the same standard on SmollTalk.
          We’re asking you to be considerate, think before you act, and abide by our
          community guidelines both on and offline. You heard that right: your offline
          behavior can lead to termination of your SmollTalk account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is a list of our community policies. If you violate any of these
          policies, you might be banned from SmollTalk. We encourage you to report (email
          us at support@smolltalk.com ) any behavior that violates our policies, and read
          up on our <a href="/safety">Safety Tips</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>SmollTalk IS NOT FOR:</h2>
        <h3>Nudity/Sexual Content</h3>
        <p>
          Please keey it clean when sharing images or uploading profile pictures. No
          nudity, no sexually explicit content, and don’t chronicle all of your sexual
          desires in your bio. Keep it clean.
        </p>
        <h3>Harassment</h3>
        <p>
          Do not engage, or encourage others to engage, in any targeted abuse or
          harassment against any other user. This includes sending any unsolicited sexual
          content to your matches. Reports of stalking, threats, bullying, or
          intimidation, are taken very seriously.
        </p>
        <h3>Violence and Physical Harm</h3>
        <p>
          We do not tolerate violent, graphic, or gory content on SmollTalk, or any
          actions or content that advocate for or threaten violence of any sort,
          including threatening or promoting terrorism. Physical assault, coercion, and
          any acts of violence are strictly prohibited.
        </p>
        <p>
          Content that advocates for or glorifies suicide or self-harm is also not
          allowed. In these situations, we may take a number of steps to assist the user,
          including reaching out with crisis resources.
        </p>
        <h3>Hate Speech</h3>
        <p>
          Any content that promotes, advocates for, or condones racism, bigotry, hatred,
          or violence against individuals or groups based on factors like (but not
          limited to) race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, disability, gender, age,
          national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity is not allowed.
        </p>
        <h3>Private Information</h3>
        <p>
          Don’t publicly broadcast any private information, yours or anyone else’s. This
          includes social security numbers, passports, passwords, financial information
          or unlisted contact information, such as phone numbers, email addresses,
          home/work address.
        </p>
        <h3>Spam</h3>
        <p>
          Don’t be fake. Be real instead. Don’t use SmollTalk to drive people to external
          websites via a link or otherwise.
        </p>
        <h3>Promotion or Solicitation</h3>
        <p>
          Soliciting other users is prohibited on SmollTalk. It’s fine to invite your
          matches to something that you’re doing, but if the purpose of your profile is
          to advertise your event or business, non-profit, political campaign, contest,
          or to conduct research, we may delete your account. While we’re excited that
          you’re doing a comedy show next week, please don’t use SmollTalk to promote it.
        </p>
        <h3>Prostitution and Trafficking</h3>
        <p>
          Promoting or advocating for commercial sexual services, human trafficking or
          other non-consensual sexual acts is strictly prohibited and will result in your
          account being banned from SmollTalk.
        </p>
        <h3>Scamming</h3>
        <p>
          SmollTalk has a zero-tolerance policy on predatory behavior of any kind. Anyone
          attempting to get other users’ private information for fraudulent or illegal
          activity may be banned. Any user caught sharing their own financial account
          information (PayPal, Venmo, etc.) for the purpose of receiving money from other
          users may also be banned from SmollTalk.
        </p>
        <h3>Impersonation</h3>
        <p>
          Do not impersonate, or otherwise misrepresent affiliation, connection or
          association with, any person or entity. This includes parody accounts. While we
          think your Mike Pence profile is hilarious, you aren’t Mike Pence. And if you
          are, what are you doing on SmollTalk?
        </p>
        <h3>Copyright and Trademark Infringement</h3>
        <p>
          If it’s not yours, don’t post it. If your SmollTalk profile includes any work
          that is copyrighted or trademarked by others, don’t display it, unless you are
          allowed to do so.
        </p>
        <h3>Illegal Usage</h3>
        <p>
          Don’t use SmollTalk to do anything illegal. If it’s illegal IRL, it’s illegal
          on SmollTalk.
        </p>
        <h3>One Person, One Account</h3>
        <p>
          SmollTalk accounts cannot have multiple owners, so don’t create an account with
          your friend or significant other. Additionally, please don’t maintain multiple
          SmollTalk accounts.
